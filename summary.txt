1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
typescript
express
node

hashmap obviously for constant lookup and updating for Payers
talk about using min-heap to optimize the algorithm
give the complexity analysis
why did i import moment

why did I use interfaces over types or classes?

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
advantages: backwards compatbility, industry standard, big O performance

complexotiy analysis
space complexity

coudl store each point individually as an object with its own timestamp
insane memory constraints, definitely not doable
O(nlogn) time complexity tho

disadvantges: language performacne, node, 

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
networks, TCP implementation, 
working with low-level languages C, debugging, shotting myself in the foot with malloc, being very careful
understanding completely the workings of the language
